# Ingenious Assessment 1

## Overview

This project is **Ingenious Assessment 1**, which focuses on solving a data-processing problem 1.

## Objective

The goal is to **count the maximum number of elements in a column** when a specific **row is provided as input**. The logic returns count for the String List.

## Features

- Accepts row input and processes column data.
- Efficiently computes maximum element count in columns for the given row.
- Clean, modular implementation suitable for integration and testing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the application using your preferred environment (Java Eclipse/IntelliJ).
3. Provide the row input.
4. Get the result: maximum element count in columns.
